Even though this works with Tim's menuing system, Tim's menuing system is now a part of this repo as small changes and restructuring had to be done. Mostly, if not all, in regards to filepath locations.

## What is all this? Gulp?

Gulp is used as a tool for workflow. I am using it to push files to the Raspberry Pi every time I save a file. This way, I can test on real hardware but work off of my native environment. Plus this has forced a file structure that contains EVERYTHING in one place (even though on the pi things get parsed apart).
